# Pie Client

A client for connecting to, sending and receiving messages from an echo server instance.
Has a `development` mode that simulates the existance of an echo server.

This package will act as both a development tool (for making apps that use the echo server without actually connecting to an echo server) and as an echo server client package that hides echo server's public API behind simple publicly exported methods.

Development of this package pending final spec for echo server API.
